# About

**Crosswalk is an HTML application runtime, built on open source foundations, which extends the web platform with new capabilities.**

The web platform already has many advantages, from easy cloud services integration to flexible user interface elements. Recently, the platform has become even more attractive, with its increased focus on mobile performance and device APIs.

However, for many developers, basic functionality is still missing, making it hard to adopt the web as it is today.

**With Crosswalk, the situation changes.**

By using Crosswalk, an application developer can:

*   Access the latest recommended and emerging web standards.
*   Control the upgrade cycle of an application by distributing it with its own runtime.
*   Add custom extensions to an application, to leverage platform features not exposed by Crosswalk or the standardized web platform.

At the heart of Crosswalk is the Blink rendering and layout engine. This provides the same HTML5 features and capabilities you would expect to find in any modern web browser.

Building on Blink, Crosswalk uses Chromium features to provide a multi-process architecture, designed for security and performance, as well as state-of-the-art performance and graphics.

Crosswalk is open source, released under a [BSD licence](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk/blob/master/LICENSE). The project was founded by Intel's Open Source Technology Center.
