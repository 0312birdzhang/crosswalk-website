# Getting started with Crosswalk

This tutorial is designed to help you get up and running with Crosswalk as quickly as possible.

This tutorial covers:

*   How to set up the tools needed to deploy Crosswalk applications, on Linux or Windows.
*   How to build and run simple HTML5 applications using stable releases of Crosswalk. The versions used for this tutorial are:
    *   Crosswalk Android for x86, version ${XWALK-STABLE-ANDROID-X86}
    *   Crosswalk Tizen for x86, version ${XWALK-STABLE-TIZEN-X86}

This tutorial doesn't cover:

*   How to write HTML5 applications. We use the simplest possible HTML5 application for this tutorial, so we can focus on the packaging and deployment aspects of Crosswalk.
*   How to use Crosswalk-specific APIs. The code in the tutorial should run perfectly well on any modern web browser, as well as on Crosswalk.
*   How to write [Crosswalk extensions](#wiki/Crosswalk-Extensions). This will be covered in other tutorials.
*   How to compile Crosswalk itself. This is covered in the [Contribute](#contribute) section.

You will need to be comfortable using a command line to follow this tutorial.

By the end of the tutorial, you should understand the workflow for creating Crosswalk applications from your own HTML5 projects.
