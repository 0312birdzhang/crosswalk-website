# Samples

We have packaged three simple applications to get you up and running with Crosswalk. These applications are [available as a download](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk-samples/archive/0.1.tar.gz). The source code is [on github](https://github.com/crosswalk-project/crosswalk-samples) (MIT licence).

To use the samples, download the sample archive, then unpack it from the command line:

```sh
tar xvf 0.1.tar.gz
```

This will create a `crosswalk-samples-0.1` directory with three project sub-directories:

* `hello_world` &ndash; A minimal example.

* `webgl` &ndash; An example of how to use WebGL in Crosswalk via [three.js](http://threejs.org/).

* `tizen_apis` &ndash; A sample application using the Tizen APIs.

For information on each of the samples, follow the links in the menu.
