# Crosswalk with Cordova 3.0

<hr>
<strong>Note:</strong> Newer versions of Cordova (4.0+), allow Crosswalk to be used easily as a puggable webview. Unless you must use Cordova version 3 or lower, it is recommended that you use that method: [Using Crosswalk WebView in Cordova Android 4.0](http://xwalk.com/documentation/cordova.html)

## Overview
Using Cordova v3, there is a way to get the best of both Crosswalk and Cordova by using *Crosswalk Cordova for Android*. This provides Cordova's APIs plus additional APIs available in Crosswalk (WebGL, SIMD, Presentation API etc.). The packages available [for download](/documentation/downloads.html) provide tools for creating Cordova Android applications with Crosswalk as the web view. Such applications will work on Android version 4.0 or later.

The intention is for Crosswalk Cordova for Android to be as compatible as possible with [Cordova Android](https://github.com/apache/cordova-android). Consequently, the [Cordova Android Platform Guide](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.3.0/guide_platforms_android_index.md.html#Android%20Platform%20Guide) is a good guide to getting started with Crosswalk Cordova for Android. Alternatively, see the [HelloWorld example](/documentation/cordova/cordova_3/develop_an_application.html) for a more Crosswalk-focused overview.
